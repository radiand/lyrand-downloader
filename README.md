# lyrand-downloader

Supporting script for **lyrand**.

Download lyrics for given artist and track name.

## usage

```bash
python3 download.py EXPORTIFY_CSV_FILE -o out.json
```

where `EXPORTIFY_CSV_FILE` is a .csv generated by [Exportify](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify) and has following layout:

```csv
Spotify URI,Track Name,Artist Name,Album Name,Disc Number,Track Number,Track Duration (ms),Added By,Added At

-09T18:02:15Z"
```

## installation

[Manually](https://github.com/sahib/glyr/wiki/Compiling) compile and install `glyr`.
Don't use your Linux distrubution packages manager to install `libglyr-dev` because it is probably
outdated and does not include patches to properly parse lyrics providers.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
